## Reflection
After this talk, I gain some information and insights related to system development career. To be a system developer, I will try to engage myself more in the industrial activities related to system development whenever I have chance in the next four years to obtain useful insights. Besides that, I will stay updated to emerging technologies and try to adapt to them. I would also like to take part in projects related to system development in the next four years to gain actual developing experiences.
